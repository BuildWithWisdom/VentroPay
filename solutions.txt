Whatsapp and mobile users headache

The best solution is to use a single, unified `users`
  table that can accommodate both types of users. Here’s a
  detailed breakdown of the recommended approach.

  The Strategy: A Unified User Model


  The core idea is that a "user" is a central concept in
  your application, but a user can have different ways of
  authenticating or identifying themselves (via phone for
  WhatsApp, or email/password for the mobile app).

  1. Recommended Table Structure

  You will have two main tables related to users:


  A. `auth.users` (Built-in Supabase Table)
   * This is a private, secure table managed by Supabase.
   * It stores sensitive authentication data (like hashed
     passwords, email, etc.).
   * Users who sign up through your mobile app will have a
     record here.
   * You should not modify this table's structure directly.


  B. `public.users` (Your Custom Table)
   * This is the table you will create and control. It will
     hold all users from both channels.
   * It will store public profile information that is safe
     to access from your application.
   * Recommended Columns:
       * id (uuid, Primary Key): A unique ID for every
         user.
       * auth_id (uuid, Foreign Key to auth.users.id,
         nullable): This is the crucial link. For mobile
         app users, this will contain their ID from
         auth.users. For WhatsApp-only users, this will be
         NULL.
       * phone_number (text, unique): The primary
         identifier for WhatsApp users.
       * email (text, nullable, unique): The primary
         identifier for mobile app users.
       * full_name (text, nullable): Other profile data.
       * created_at (timestamp): When the user record was
         created.

  2. Workflow for Each Channel

  Here’s how you handle each user type:

  A. Mobile App Workflow (Full Authentication)


   1. Sign Up: A user signs up on the mobile app with an
      email and password. You call the createUser method we
      discussed, which uses supabase.auth.signUp().
   2. `auth.users` Record Created: Supabase automatically
      creates a new record in the auth.users table.
   3. Create Public Profile (The Magic Step): You need to
      automatically create a corresponding profile in your
      public.users table. The best way to do this is with a
      database trigger.
       * You create a function in your Supabase SQL editor
         that runs every time a new user is added to
         auth.users.
       * This function copies the id and email from the new
         auth.users record into a new row in public.users,
         setting the auth_id field.
       * This ensures every authenticated user has a public
         profile automatically.


  B. WhatsApp Workflow (Phone-Only Authentication)

  This is where your backend logic comes in. You'll
  implement a "get-or-create" flow.


   1. First Message: A new user sends a message to your
      WhatsApp number.
   2. Webhook Received: Your /twilio/webhook endpoint
      receives the request, which includes the user's phone
      number in body.From.
   3. Check for Existing User: In your service, you take the
      phone number and query your public.users table:


   1     // In a new method in AuthService, e.g.,
     handleWhatsAppUser(phoneNumber)
   2     const { data: existingUser, error } =
     await this.client
   3       .from('users')
   4       .select('*')
   5       .eq('phone_number', phoneNumber)
   6       .single(); // .single() gets one record
     or null

   4. Logic:
       * If `existingUser` is found: Great! You know who
         they are. You can proceed with your app logic
         using their user record.
       * If `existingUser` is `null`: This is a brand new
         user. You create a record for them in your
         public.users table:

   1       const { data: newUser, error } = await
     this.client
   2         .from('users')
   3         .insert([{ phone_number: phoneNumber
     }])
   4         .select()
   5         .single();

        This new user will have a phone_number but their
  auth_id and email will be NULL.

  3. Linking Accounts


  This model makes it easy to link accounts later. If a
  WhatsApp user downloads the mobile app, you can have a
  screen in your app that says "Already a user? Verify
  your phone number." When they sign up with an
  email/password and verify their phone number, you can
  find their existing record in public.users and update
  the auth_id field, merging the two identities.
